        "article": "LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

        "article": "Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \"forgotten floor,\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \"forgotten floor.\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \"avoidable felonies.\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \"lunatics\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \"forgotten floor\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served. E-mail to a friend .",

        "instruction": "Please generate an concise summarization for the following article：\n:By . Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 20:46 EST, 30 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:48 EST, 2 December 2013 . The ex-girlfriend of Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins claims the paedophile rock musician had fantasies about kidnapping and murdering a baby. Joanne Mjadzelics, 38, claims Watkins' sick behaviour would have eventually degenerated into even more extreme crimes if he had not been caught. Watkins was described as a 'determined and committed paedophile' after he admitted attempting to rape a fan's 11-month-old baby son along with 10 other child sex offences on Tuesday. Horror: Joanne Majic, the ex-girlfriend of Ian Watkins, said he had fantasies about kidnapping and murdering a baby . Miss Mjadzelics had a two year on-off relationship with the rock star from 2006 and as time went on, Watkins revealed his sordid fantasies. In August 2008, after receiving emails from the singer describing sex with an 11-year-old girl and suggestive photographs of a three-year-old, she went to police. She told the Sunday People: 'I’m absolutely sure Ian wouldn’t have stopped at abuse. 'He wanted to rape and kill children. He wanted to rape newborns. 'He even wanted to get me pregnant so he could rape our baby.' The singer, a former boyfriend of BBC presenter Fearne Cotton and model Alexa Chung, also admitted to her he used his Lostprophets fame to turn young girls into ‘Superfans’ willing to allow him to abuse their children. Former lover: Miss Mjadzelics had a two year on-off relationship with the rock star from 2006 and as time went on, Watkins revealed his sordid fantasies . The former lead singer with multi-million selling band Lostprophets made a series of admissions in a last-minute change of plea ahead of what would have been his trial at Cardiff Crown Court . Miss Mjadzelics also says she warned police about the singer's depraved nature four years ago after he told her he wanted to have sex with a child, but says they refused to investigate it. She was persuaded to give up as Watkins was alerted about her claims and she was threatened with harassment charges. But a year later he was bombarding her with more sick fantasies, revealed he was now addicted to heroin and had raped a five-year-old girl. At that point, she started to gather a file of evidence that eventually led to Watkins' conviction. Miss Mjadzelics claimed besotted female fans of the paedophile are hiding the true . extent of his offending because they secretly offered their children for . abuse. Her claims come as another of Watkins' former lovers, Lostprophets fan Krysta Boyle, reveals he gushed over her tiny frame. Ms Boyle, from Orange County in . California, was 19 years old, 4'11\", and wore child-size clothing when . she met the singer in Hawaii. She told The Sun on Sunday: 'Looking . back, it was obvious something was wrong with him from the moment we . met. But I was a young impressionable fan. 'I remember him commenting a lot on my body and small frame.' She added that he tried to film their sexual encounters and once choked her during sex. Today his ex-bandmates insisted they did not know about the abuse. Speaking for the first time since Watkins' last-minute change of plea on Tuesday ahead of what would have been his trial at Cardiff Crown Court, they released a statement to fans revealing they were 'heartbroken, angry and disgusted'. They said: 'Many of you understandably want to know if we knew what Ian was doing. To be clear: We did not. 'We knew that Ian was a difficult . character. Our personal relationships with him had deteriorated in . recent years to a point that working together was a constant, miserable . challenge. 'But despite his battles with drugs, his egotistic behaviour and the . resulting fractures and frustrations within our band, we never imagined . him capable of behaviour of the type he has now admitted.' The Independent Police Complaints . Commission (IPCC) is investigating claims that South Wales Police failed . to act quickly enough having allegedly been told Watkins was planning . to abuse children as early as 2008. They . have now launched a second investigation over the handling of a . complaint made against Watkins to South Yorkshire Police in 2012. Watkins . was arrested late last year after South Wales Police raided his home on . a drugs tip and stumbled upon hard drives containing images, videos and . conversations about him attacking children. From . early 2010 horrified fans who had become friends with Watkins went . online to beg for help after discovering vile images on his computer. In one post, written before his arrest, a fan wrote: ‘His on-off girlfriend reported him to police twice for being a paedophile. ‘He . sent pornographic pictures of a little girl to a few girls telling them . it was a five-year-old girl he’d raped. He also watches child porn . constantly. Sick sick man.’ Watkins allegedly boasted to obsessed female fans that he had HIV and was on a mission to pass it on to children. Watkins, 38, is due to be sentenced next month after . he admitted to a string of horrific child sex offences including . attempting to rape a fan's 11-month-old baby boy . The comments will only add to the growing . fear that Watkins's guilty pleas offer only a glimpse of the true . extent of his drug-fuelled debauchery. The 36-year-old, from Pontypridd, South . Wales, plotted the shocking abuse with the two mothers of the babies in a . series of text and internet messages. The baby's mother, Woman A, admits aiding and abetting the attempted rapes on her son. She also admits sexually touching the child and taking photographs, before sending them to Watkins. Watkins also admitted conspiring to rape and sexually touch the daughter of the second fan. He admits aiding and abetting Woman B to touch her daughter while he watched on Skype. An . earlier court hearing was told police had 72 pages of conversations . between the pair online talking about their sexual relationship. Woman B mentioned she had a daughter of a young age and Watkins said: 'Bring her along as well.' She said she was getting the child ready for their meeting together - and 'what they all will do together' when they meet up. She . admits sexual assault after touching the child, she also admits taking . an indecent photograph of the child before distributing them. Anyone who has been affected by the Watkins case, or other cases of child abuse, is urged to contact South Wales Police on 029 20634184 or the NSPCC on 0808 800 5000.",

Oren Miller, a stay-at-home father to Liam, six, and four-year-old Madeline, was diagnosed with terminal cancer last May after suffering from shortness of breath and severe pain in his back. Tragically, he and his wife, Beth Blauer, from Owing Mills, Maryland, were told the disease had already spread to his liver, his lymph nodes and his brain. He was given only a year to live. Mr Miller, whose 'A Father and a Blogger' site was hugely popular among parents, battled stage four cancer for nine months, before succumbing to it on Saturday, his family told the Baltimore Sun. Tragic: Oren Miller (pictured with his wife, Beth Blauer, son, Liam and daughter, Madeline) was diagnosed with lung cancer last May after suffering from shortness of breath and severe pain in his back. He died Saturday . Father and daughter: When Mr Miller (pictured with Madeline), of Owing Mills, Maryland, was diagnosed, he was told the disease had already spread to his liver, his lymph nodes and his brain. He was given only a year to live . An inspirational figure: Mr Miller (pictured), whose 'A Father and a Blogger' blog was hugely popular among parents, battled his cancer for nine months, before succumbing to it on Saturday, his family said on Monday . A funeral service was held for him at Sol Levinson & Bros. Funeral Home in Baltimore on Monday afternoon. His death has also inspired hundreds of online tributes from fans and other bloggers. In one of his most prominent posts on his blog following his cancer diagnosis, Mr Miller told his thousands of readers: 'I believe in Heaven on Earth, and I believe it's found anywhere you seek it.' He continued: 'I found Heaven on long car rides with the kids', adding that he used daily trips to school to 'chat' with his children about their worlds, music, life values and, of course, 'nonsense'. And he said that he 'found Heaven on the dirty floor of a basketball court', where he would pass the ball back and forth with his then-two-year-old daughter as they waited for Liam to finish school. In a separate post, he wrote: 'We all know I will be loved until my last moment by people it has been my utmost privilege to know: by a wife I adore and two kids I'm in awe of every single moment.' In addition his inspirational blog, Mr Miller set up a Facebook page, 'Dad Bloggers', shortly after the birth of his son. The page currently has more than 1,500 members from over 15 countries. Family: A funeral service was held for Mr Miller at Sol Levinson & Bros. Funeral Home in Baltimore on Monday afternoon.

They raised more than $13,000 for his medical care in just 24 hours. As word of his condition spread, they ultimately raised more than $36,000 for the Miller family,TODAY Parents reported. Mr Miller previously told the news site: 'I’ve always said that the group is not me, it’s whatever people put into it. But I’m equally as happy to see that people appreciate what I did, I guess.' Incredibly, the fathers within the 'Dad Bloggers' community rallied again when they learned that Mr Miller and his wife were forced to miss a Billy Joel concert in New York's Madison Square Garden. They recorded themselves covering  Joel's songs from their kitchens, bathrooms and even garages, before posting a compilation to YouTube. Some played the piano, while others played the guitar. Happier times: Mr Miller's online presence was so great that when he was diagnosed with cancer nine months ago, his fellow bloggers, friends and other members of the public rushed to his and his family's support . Having fun: Mr Miller is pictured posing behind a cardboard image of a doctor (left) and with his daughter (right) Tribute: Dad 2.0 Summit paid tribute to Mr Miller on Facebook, calling him a 'forthright curator of online dads' In the past few days, hundreds of people have been taking to Mr Miller's Facebook page and other sites to pay tribute to him. Using the hashtag #Dads4Oren, they have shared their memories of him. In an online post, Australian blogger Dadinator wrote: 'Men don’t talk enough. It’s why we’re more likely to suffer mental illness. Why we die younger. Why we are more likely to take our own lives. 'Oren was a man who talked, who talked about the importance of talking and who shared himself and his journey as a father. But he was more than that, he built a community of men who talk.' Another blogger, Brent Almond, wrote on his Designer Daddy site: 'One of Oren’s greatest passions was for the words of modern fathers - regardless of the size of their audience or the strength of their voice - to be heard in a Facebook group he has built, maintained and supported.'",

To enforce his blockade, Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic collapse of the Grand Army, forcing the French to retreat, as well as leading to the widespread destruction of Russian lands and cities. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France. A chaotic military campaign in Central Europe eventually culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October. The next year, the Allies invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island of Elba. The Bourbons were restored to power and the French lost most of the territories that they had conquered since the Revolution. However, Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of the government once again. The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which ultimately defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June. The Royal Navy then thwarted his planned escape to the United States in July, so he surrendered to the British after running out of other options. The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic. His death in 1821 at the age of 51 was received with shock and grief throughout Europe. In 1840, a million people witnessed his remains returning to Paris, where they still reside at Les Invalides.\nquestion:In addition to Russia, the Sixth Coalition consisted of forces from which two nations?",

The name was soon altered by the Spanish to Apalachee and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. Pánfilo de Narváez's expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name. Now spelled \"Appalachian,\" it is the fourth-oldest surviving European place-name in the US.\nquestion:When did the Narvaez expedition explore Florida?",

总结：
1. 翻译任务上，训练了之后，在翻译任务上，略有提升，摘要训练之后也对翻译有提升，而且比翻译本身还明显，问答任务训练之后也对翻译有提升。
2. 摘要任务上，训练之后提升明显，翻译训练对摘要基本没提升，问答任务对摘要有一点帮助。
3. 问答任务训练之后又提升，翻译、摘要对问答没有提升。摘要训练之后，对问答任务反而有下降。
